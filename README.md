# Eye-Cancer-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
# 🧠 Eye Cancer Insights Dashboard
**A Power BI Exploration of Clinical Trends, Treatments, and Outcomes**

## 📘 Project Description

This project analyzes a medical dataset of **5,000 eye cancer patients**, including cases of **Melanoma**, **Retinoblastoma**, and **Lymphoma**. Using **Power BI**, I created a fully interactive dashboard that visualizes patient demographics, treatment pathways, survival outcomes, and recovery patterns. 

By applying slicing, filtering, and custom DAX measures, this dashboard transforms raw clinical data into **insightful visual stories** that could inform health professionals, researchers, and decision-makers.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify the **most prevalent eye cancer types**.
- Evaluate **treatment patterns** (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy).
- Analyze **demographic trends** by age, gender, and country.
- Assess **survival time**, **recovery rate**, and **mortality**.
- Support **data-driven decisions** in oncology care through visuals.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### ✅ KPIs (DAX Measures)
- **Total Patients**: 5,000
- **Most Common Cancer Type**: Melanoma
- **Average Survival Time**: 60.72 months
- **Recovery Rate**: 34%
- **Mortality Rate**: 34%
- **Surgery Count**: 2,000
- **Genetic Survival Index**: 60.45

### 🧩 Visuals Used
- **Card visuals** for KPIs
- **Sankey diagram** to map treatment flows by cancer type
- **Map** to display country-level diagnosis distribution
- **Donut & Bar Charts** for cancer types, outcomes, and age groups
- **Slicers** for gender, country, diagnosis year, and cancer type

## 🔍 Insights & Observations

- **Melanoma** was the most commonly diagnosed cancer type.
- Patients **aged 60+** accounted for the highest diagnosis rates.
- **Multimodal treatments** (e.g., chemo + radiation) were common and varied by cancer type.
- **Recovery and mortality rates** were equal (34%), with ~32% unaccounted — potentially still in treatment or underreported.
- Patients with **genetic markers** had a notable survival index, suggesting room for personalized care.

## 🩺 Recommendations

- Prioritize **routine screening for seniors** (especially 60+ age group).
- Expand access to **genetic testing and profiling**.
- Introduce **localized screening programs** in underrepresented countries.
- Improve **tracking systems** for treatment follow-up and patient outcome logging.
- Encourage **analysis of treatment combinations** for survival outcome benchmarking.
